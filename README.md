# seedDNS
Hotcache your local dns with most visited sites 


seedDNS arose from the need to test my local DNS servers, I am preparing for LPIC2 part 2 and one of the exam topics is DNS server administration.
As I wanted to explore the study tools a little more and needed some load, I wrote this small script that collects the most accessed sites compiled by Alexa and makes a request to the local DNS server.

Feeding the DNS cache.

## what you need?
python3.6+, sed, dig
